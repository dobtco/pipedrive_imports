> Pipedrive has improved their import wizard, so these scripts are no longer necessary for most use cases.


Pipedrive import scripts
-----

1. `bundle install`
2. `cp .env.example .env` and configure
3. `./script_of_your_choice path/to/contacts.csv`

For required columns, look in the individual scripts.
